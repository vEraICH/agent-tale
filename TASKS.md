## Memory System — Agent-Tale as LLM Memory Backend

Research: `docs/research/llm-memory.md`

Dogfood consolidation (Option B) completed 2026-04-07: 4 knowledge summary posts written from 12 devlogs.
Friction list captured in `devlog-2026-04-07.md`. MCP server (2.5 + 2.6) completed same session — mem-1 and mem-3 blockers now cleared.

| # | Task | Status | Depends | Context Doc | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| mem-0 | VRA Lab blog post: "We built this before Karpathy named it" | `completed` | — | `docs/research/llm-memory.md` | Option C. Public-facing post on vra-lab about Agent-Tale as Markdown-First Architecture, validated by Karpathy April 2026. |
| mem-1 | Memory-scoped MCP tools | `pending` | ~~2.5~~ ✓ | `docs/research/llm-memory.md` | Thin adapter layer over MCP tools using OpenMemory API naming: `store_memory`, `retrieve_memory`, `get_memory_context`. `memory` as a first-class collection type. Any MCP-compatible agent treats Agent-Tale as drop-in memory backend with zero architecture change. **2.5 completed 2026-04-07 — blocker cleared.** |
| mem-2 | Bi-temporal frontmatter schema | `completed` | — | `docs/research/llm-memory.md` | Add `valid_until`, `superseded_by`, `confidence`, `sources` to frontmatter schema + SQLite graph index. Every post becomes a temporally bounded fact. Agents can query "what did we believe about X in Q4 2025?" History preserved, not overwritten. |
| mem-2a | `type: knowledge` visual treatment | `completed` | — | — | KnowledgeLayout with badge, left border, provenance panel. Badge in PostCard list. Core frontmatter schema updated. |
| mem-3 | Agent-authored consolidation MCP tool | `pending` | ~~2.5~~ ✓ | `docs/research/llm-memory.md` | `consolidate_memories({ topic, source_slugs })` — agent reads N episodic posts, authors a semantic summary post, wikilinks back to sources, stamps `consolidated_into` on originals. Episodic → semantic layer in the graph. Auditable markdown consolidation; no other memory system does this. **2.5 completed 2026-04-07 — blocker cleared.** |

| 2.8 | Dogfood: Claude Code writes via MCP | `pending` | 2.5, 2.7 | `docs/dogfooding.md` | Integration test: Claude Code uses MCP to write posts about its own work |
| 2.9 | Unlinked mentions detection | `pending` | 1.3 | `docs/content-model.md` | Scan content for title/slug matches without explicit links |
| 2.10 | `agent-tale check` CLI command | `pending` | 1.3 | `docs/conventions.md` | Validate content: broken wikilinks, missing frontmatter, orphan detection |
| 2.11 | Integration test suite | `pending` | 2.5 | `docs/testing.md` | End-to-end: write via MCP → verify graph → verify rendered HTML |
