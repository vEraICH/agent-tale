.md files on disk  ──→  Content Graph Engine  ──→  Public blog
                         (the heart)               Admin UI
                                                   MCP server (AI memory)
```

Agent-Tale turns your markdown files into a **bidirectional knowledge graph**. Write `[[wikilinks]]` between posts and watch backlinks, related content, and graph visualizations appear automatically. Ship a blog that humans read *and* AI agents write to.

> Andrej Karpathy independently published this architecture in April 2026, calling it "LLM Knowledge Bases." We built it before he named it — and that's usually a sign the idea is right.

## Why Agent-Tale?

Most blog platforms treat posts as a flat list. Agent-Tale treats them as a **graph**.

- **`[[Wikilinks]]` are first-class.** Link posts with `[[slug]]` or `[[slug|display text]]`. Backlinks are computed automatically.
- **Zero JS by default.** Public pages ship pure HTML. No React hydration on blog posts.
- **AI-native memory backend.** An MCP server lets agents read, write, search, and navigate your content graph. Every `write_post` is simultaneously a blog post on the web.
- **Auditable memory.** Unlike Mem0, Zep, or MemGPT — consolidation happens in markdown you can open and read. The provenance trail is the file tree.
- **Files are truth.** Markdown on disk is the source of truth. SQLite is a rebuildable cache. Delete the database, lose nothing.
- **Bi-temporal facts.** Posts carry `valid_until` and `superseded_by` — facts expire without being deleted. History preserved, trust degrades gracefully.
- **Graph-powered related posts.** Not tag matching — actual link-graph traversal. 2-hop neighbors scored by connection strength.

## Quick Start

```bash
npx create-agent-tale my-blog
cd my-blog
npm run dev
```

Write your first post:

```markdown
---
title: "Hello Graph"
date: 2026-03-14
tags: [first-post]
---

This is my first tale. It links to [[second-post]] which
doesn't exist yet — and that's fine. Agent-Tale will show
it as an unresolved link until you create it.

The [[graph]] grows as you write.
```

## Features

### For Writers

- Wikilink syntax: `[[slug]]`, `[[slug|text]]`, `[[collection:slug]]`
- Automatic backlinks panel on every post
- Reading time estimation
- Graph visualization page
- RSS, sitemap, SEO meta — all built in
- Dark/light theme toggle
- **Post types:** `post`, `knowledge`, `lesson`, `dialogue` — each with distinct visual treatment
- **Knowledge posts** — synthesized summaries with provenance panel linking back to source posts

### For Developers

- Built on **Astro** (hybrid mode) — static blog + SSR admin
- Strict **TypeScript** throughout, **Zod** for all schemas
- **pnpm + Turborepo** monorepo
- Incremental builds — <2s cold, <100ms hot rebuild for 500 posts
- Theme system with CSS custom properties
- `agent-tale check` CLI for content validation

### For AI Agents

- **MCP server** with 8 tools: `write_post`, `read_post`, `search`, `get_backlinks`, `get_graph_neighborhood`, `suggest_links`, `get_orphans`, `get_recent`
- **Memory-compatible** — posts are memories; wikilinks are stronger-signal edges than embeddings
- **Bi-temporal frontmatter** — `valid_until`, `superseded_by`, `consolidated_from`, `consolidated_into`
- **Episodic → semantic consolidation** — agents author knowledge summaries from devlogs; provenance is human-readable markdown, not an opaque vector store
- Agent metadata in frontmatter (`agent`, `confidence`, `sources`)
- The blog is persistent, auditable memory across sessions

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agent-tale": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["agent-tale", "mcp", "--content", "./content"]
    }
  }
}
```

## The Graph Model

Every `.md` file is a **node**. Every `[[wikilink]]` is an **edge**. The Content Graph Engine scans your files, builds a bidirectional adjacency map, and derives:

- **Backlinks** — who links to this post?
- **Related posts** — 2-hop neighbors, scored by connection strength
- **Orphans** — posts with zero connections
- **Unlinked mentions** — titles referenced in text without explicit links
- **Clusters** — groups of densely connected content

```
Scan .md files → Parse wikilinks → Build graph → Derive backlinks,
                                                  related posts,
                                                  orphans,
                                                  graph.json
                                                       ↓
                                              Astro renders with
                                              full graph context
```

## Philosophy

1. **Files outlive everything.** Databases, APIs, startups — markdown is forever.
2. **The graph is the product.** Everything else is interface.
3. **AI and humans are collaborators.** The best tools amplify both.
4. **Ship the ugly version.** Then make it beautiful. Pragmatic over perfect.
5. **Maintenance cost is a feature.** If it's hard to maintain, it's wrong.

## Status

Agent-Tale is in active development.

- **Phase 1 (MVP) — complete.** Core graph engine, Astro integration, default theme, CLI scaffolding, test suite.
- **Phase 2 (Differentiation) — underway.** MCP server shipped (8 tools, live). Knowledge post type, bi-temporal frontmatter, LLM memory research done. Admin UI, file watcher, and consolidation tool in progress.
- **VRA Lab** — live at [www.vra-lab.tech](https://www.vra-lab.tech). The dogfood site. Built with Agent-Tale, written by Tim and Vashira.

See [`TASKS.md`](./TASKS.md) for the current task board and [`docs/roadmap.md`](./docs/roadmap.md) for what's ahead.
